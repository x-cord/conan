Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.55,0:13:14.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why glue was smeared on the knot in the rope, so he couldn't undo it with ease.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:14.60,0:13:18.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But weren't you able to remove the rope when you found the body?

Dialogue: 0,0:13:41.34,0:13:47.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He was forced to hold onto his precious vase behind his back.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:19.75,0:14:20.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see!
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.88,0:14:26.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If there was a loud noise, someone would come, open the door, and that would be it, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.42,0:14:32.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's why, when the door was being opened, the master shouted "Don't open."

Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.26,0:14:38.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, how did the culprit get out of the room after setting the trick up?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:38.77,0:14:40.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, let's demonstrate.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:52.12,0:14:55.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You carefully leave through the gap in the doorway, and slowly close the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:59.62,0:15:01.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I never thought of that!
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.37,0:15:04.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,With this, it would be possible to make it look like suicide, wouldn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.50,0:15:08.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, placing the culprit will be difficult.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:09.30,0:15:10.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's true...

Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.68,0:15:16.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why's that?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:17.06,0:15:22.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because if the culprit didn't use the large book, the gap in the doorway wouldn't have been wide enough for them.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:23.56,0:15:26.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And so, the culprit who needed to do that...

Dialogue: 0,0:15:41.46,0:15:43.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She went to buy it after setting it up.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:43.88,0:15:48.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She anticipated that he would ask for coffee, so she probably had it prepared ahead of time.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:00.56,0:16:04.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And then hung the rope around his neck and applied glue to the knot.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:04.52,0:16:09.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She then gently awoke him and forced him to hold the vase behind his back.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:09.94,0:16:15.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then she threatened that if he let the vase fall, she'd knock out the books.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:41.60,0:16:44.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yes, and that cruelty was joined by another, so to speak.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:58.41,0:17:00.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was simple compared with this one.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:00.49,0:17:07.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The culprit just tied up both hands and feet, stuck gum tape on his mouth, and dumped him into the pool filled with water.
