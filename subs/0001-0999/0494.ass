Dialogue: 0,0:13:08.33,0:13:14.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why glue was smeared on the knot in the rope, so he couldn't undo it with ease.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:14.41,0:13:18.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But weren't you able to remove the rope when you found the body?

Dialogue: 0,0:13:38.98,0:13:40.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What do you mean?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:41.15,0:13:46.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He was forced to hold onto his precious vase behind his back.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:57.00,0:14:03.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This is evidence that he was forced to hold onto the vase until his hands became too sweaty, right?

Dialogue: 0,0:14:19.56,0:14:20.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see!
Dialogue: 0,0:14:20.69,0:14:25.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If there was a loud noise, someone would come, open the door, and that would be it, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.20,0:14:32.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, that's why, when the door was being opened, the master shouted "Don't open."
Dialogue: 0,0:14:32.66,0:14:34.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:34.04,0:14:38.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, how did the culprit get out of the room after setting the trick up?
Dialogue: 0,0:14:38.58,0:14:40.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, let's demonstrate.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:51.93,0:14:55.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You carefully leave through the gap in the doorway, and slowly close the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:59.44,0:15:00.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I never thought of that!
Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.19,0:15:04.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,With this, it would be possible to make it look like suicide, wouldn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.28,0:15:08.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, placing the culprit will be difficult.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:09.11,0:15:10.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's true...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.36,0:15:14.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Do you know why they had to put the large book in the front of the door?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:15.49,0:15:16.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why's that?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.87,0:15:22.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because if the culprit didn't use the large book, the gap in the doorway wouldn't have been wide enough for them.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:23.38,0:15:25.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And so, the culprit who needed to do that...

Dialogue: 0,0:15:43.69,0:15:47.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She anticipated that he would ask for coffee, so she probably had it prepared ahead of time.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:00.37,0:16:04.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And then hung the rope around his neck and applied glue to the knot.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:04.33,0:16:09.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She then gently awoke him and forced him to hold the vase behind his back.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:09.76,0:16:14.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then she threatened that if he let the vase fall, she'd knock out the books.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:41.41,0:16:44.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yes, and that cruelty was joined by another, so to speak.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:58.22,0:17:00.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was simple compared with this one.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:00.31,0:17:07.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The culprit just tied up both hands and feet, stuck gum tape on his mouth, and dumped him into the pool filled with water.
