Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.56,0:05:44.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You're having me go back to them as a spy when they're already suspicious, after all.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:14.68,0:06:20.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I guess that could probably apply, since the boy knows their boss's e-mail address...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.06,0:06:23.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm worried about the people in the hospital too.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.86,0:06:29.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They probably think they were conspiring with the FBI hide to Mizunashi Rena all along.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.41,0:06:31.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We have to...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.70,0:06:32.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There's nothing to worry about.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.87,0:06:36.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Mizunashi Rena{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} is probably already...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.83,0:06:43.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We should just leave the hospital alone?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.59,0:06:47.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You think we should leave all those people who helped the FBI alone?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.22,0:06:51.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They weren't helping them, it seems.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.14,0:06:57.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The FBI claimed I was Akai Shuuichi's sister to have me admitted.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.60,0:07:00.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, aren't you a famous announcer?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.27,0:07:04.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They had to say I resembled her a number of times.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.86,0:07:08.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They also said that if I were really her, the media would have been all over the incident.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.03,0:07:15.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Of course, the FBI asked many others to help cover up my being unaccounted for.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.74,0:07:17.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why, Kir?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.50,0:07:20.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why do you care what becomes of that hospital?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.25,0:07:23.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.17,0:07:23.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Is something there?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.33,0:07:25.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Not really.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.46,0:07:30.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,For some reason or other, I just don't wish to kill the people who took care of me...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:31.38,0:07:32.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I wouldn't really enjoy it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.68,0:07:42.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, if the employees in that hospital were cooperating with the FBI and knew the Organization was coming to rescue me...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.23,0:07:45.19,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think they would have come up with some countermeasures.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.77,0:07:48.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,For now, we won't act.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.36,0:07:49.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Just as you wish.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.07,0:07:51.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"For now," you say?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:52.32,0:07:53.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's difficult to swallow.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.95,0:07:59.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That Akai set up a plan that allowed us to retrieve Kir so easily.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.08,0:08:03.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There must be something behind it.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.58,0:08:08.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Speaking of that guy, it's a shame we weren't able to kill him.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.25,0:08:09.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.71,0:08:16.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I figured he would certainly interfere as soon as we recovered Kir.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.72,0:08:20.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Doesn't that mean this is all he can do?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:48.79,0:08:50.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She was CIA, huh?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.75,0:08:52.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That announcer, Mizunashi Rena...
