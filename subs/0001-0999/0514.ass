Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.86,0:05:07.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But why would the police need to know something like that?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:07.28,0:05:08.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, no.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.32,0:05:11.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's just that Somei{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} has gotten involved in a trivial case.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.80,0:05:30.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Do you know who it was from?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.26,0:05:33.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm sure it was a woman.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.97,0:05:34.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,A woman?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.39,0:05:36.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He called her "Maiko".
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.69,0:05:38.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maiko?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.77,0:05:39.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maiko?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.65,0:05:45.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She was the one who came earlier with\NPresident Somei to the detective office.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.74,0:05:50.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So she telephoned President Somei at that time...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.95,0:05:56.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What's this?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.37,0:05:59.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Could it be?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:03.34,0:06:06.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then the reason President Somei went into this room first was...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.51,0:06:09.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,His real objective was...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.52,0:06:17.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The aroma of coffee.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.39,0:06:19.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's just as I thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.90,0:06:21.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So there's no body here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.15,0:06:24.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Say, was that window locked?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:25.40,0:06:26.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.32,0:06:30.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Just to be sure we opened it and checked the veranda.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.41,0:06:32.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's really raining hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.07,0:06:33.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So don't open the window.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.29,0:06:40.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The window was closed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.67,0:06:43.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yet despite that, the lace curtain underneath is damp.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.55,0:06:45.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Come to think of it...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.84,0:06:48.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When President Somei stopped in front of the apartment building...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.22,0:06:49.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,His jacket was wet.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.55,0:06:52.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So what was it like? That veranda?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.97,0:06:57.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Could they have reached the next apartment or jumped down from it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.02,0:06:58.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No way, no way.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.35,0:07:02.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The next door veranda is blocked off by a wall.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.52,0:07:06.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And there was no evidence that the emergency\Nladder was used to descend to the veranda below.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.07,0:07:08.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And most importantly, this is the 20th floor.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.40,0:07:12.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And no matter how few people might\Nbe in the parking lot directly below...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:12.61,0:07:17.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Using a rope or something to descend would be slow,\Nand somebody would notice them coming down.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.58,0:07:22.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, they could have jumped off using\Na hang glider like Kaitou Kid, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.62,0:07:24.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This rain seems too intense for that.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.63,0:07:28.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In that case, there's only one answer.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.59,0:07:33.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The sad truth is the only one.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.14,0:07:40.18,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Excuse me.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.56,0:07:43.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So would it be OK to let me leave soon?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.90,0:07:45.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's getting late after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.40,0:07:47.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And I'm still not feeling very well.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.19,0:07:50.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, no, wait a bit longer please.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.03,0:07:54.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, did you get confirmation about his health?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.24,0:07:57.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I phoned President Somei's office.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.83,0:07:59.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It seems his stomach was bothering him...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.50,0:08:01.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And he took 2 or 3 days off of work also.
