Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.85,0:06:57.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't worry.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.98,0:07:03.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Only a few doctors and nurses know that she's been admitted here.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.11,0:07:07.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Regardless, I'm surprised to hear Mizunashi Rena has a younger brother.
