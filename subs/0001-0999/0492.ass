Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.82,0:06:12.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Isn't because she's really his sister...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.29,0:06:14.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As I thought: It's because she looks exactly like her.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.75,0:06:25.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So that boy's sister looks exactly like Mizunashi Rena?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.17,0:06:31.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It seems he's somehow figured out she was injured in that incident and was admitted to a hospital.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.11,0:06:43.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Don't worry.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.23,0:06:48.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Only a few doctors and nurses know that she's been admitted here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.36,0:06:53.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Regardless, I'm surprised to hear Mizunashi Rena has a younger brother.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.36,0:07:28.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's only a possibility, as he didn't say that himself.
