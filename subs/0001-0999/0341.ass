Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.97,0:04:32.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, the reason for staying here is actually...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.48,0:04:38.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, you mean that nothing was taken during the break-ins?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.98,0:04:39.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.18,0:05:15.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's possible that, when he went to the rival design firm, he was poisoned somehow...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:16.19,0:05:18.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But the president got angry with good reason.

Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.13,0:05:49.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, accidentally found it in the slipper cupboard near the door.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.47,0:05:52.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But didn't this happen before the break-ins?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.87,0:06:20.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's how it was...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.29,0:06:25.09,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, can you please give us a tour of this design office?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.80,0:06:27.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.17,0:06:29.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Something isn't right.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.91,0:06:51.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.16,0:06:53.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It should still be there.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.58,0:06:55.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In that bathroom...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:56.79,0:06:59.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Whatever your sister hid away, it should be there.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.59,0:07:07.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.17,0:07:13.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,President Dejima may have gotten the poison on his and unknowingly while over there.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.30,0:07:15.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No—That's impossible.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.47,0:07:18.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ah, well...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.60,0:07:27.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When he returned here, he would have come into contact with something, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.78,0:07:30.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Like a door knob or the back of a chair, for instance.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.99,0:07:34.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, the places that came up positive for poison were limited to...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.00,0:07:45.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And then the packaging for the burger that he was eating before he died.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.29,0:07:49.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, since only trace amounts of poison were found there...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.51,0:07:54.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He must have come in contact with the poison before touching those places.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:55.30,0:07:57.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You should understand by now.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.47,0:07:59.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Exactly when did the president come into contact with the poison?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.60,0:08:04.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Think: Where would you need to undo your belt, pull down your pants...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.69,0:08:08.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And also use your handkerchief?
