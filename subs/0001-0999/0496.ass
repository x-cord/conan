Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.44,0:06:21.27,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.52,0:06:25.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, if we proceed with the EEG now as opposed to doing so in three days...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.44,0:06:28.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We'll know for certain.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.74,0:06:30.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, this is sufficient, Director.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.66,0:06:34.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I just wanted to some kind of confirmation.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.04,0:06:39.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Normally I would be asking a lot of questions in this situation, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:39.67,0:06:47.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I don't believe the friend who rescued me from those ruffians in L.A. back then would do anything questionable.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.55,0:06:48.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, no questions from me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.01,0:06:53.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You haven't told the director, have you?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.01,0:06:53.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The real circumstances.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.26,0:07:01.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I only told him that we're with the FBI and that she's a material witness in a case.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.27,0:07:03.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,How could I tell him?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.77,0:07:09.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That the famous announcer, Mizunashi Rena, is actually a member of a deadly organization we're hunting...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.15,0:07:15.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And that another member has infiltrated into the hospital as a patient to find her.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.24,0:07:18.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's for the director's own safety, after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.79,0:07:21.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But there is one silver lining.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.37,0:07:24.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,With her being in a coma...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.29,0:07:28.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even if those guys did locate her hospital room...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.05,0:07:33.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It would be too risky to be taking an unconscious body outside.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:34.01,0:07:35.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.22,0:07:38.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We must give 100% toward not getting discovered.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.68,0:07:42.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If only for the Director and other staff members cooperating with us.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.35,0:07:45.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even if they didn't know the situation...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.15,0:07:50.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think those known to be helping us hide her are in danger of becoming targets of the Organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.49,0:07:58.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The issue now is how will we determine which of those three is their member disguised as a patient.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.25,0:08:06.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Normally, I would take the three of them, transfer them to another hospital, and interrogate them at length.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.38,0:08:07.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This is Japan.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.38,0:08:11.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since our investigation isn't sanctioned by the Japanese police...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.97,0:08:13.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We can't do that
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.93,0:08:17.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And two of them are just normal patients.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.26,0:08:25.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Having said that, if we approach the suspects badly here, they will realize we're the FBI...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.73,0:08:28.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And they would know it's likely that she's being held in this hospital.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.82,0:08:29.65,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, then...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.94,0:08:33.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why not try the good idea I've come up with?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.57,0:08:35.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"Good idea"?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.99,0:08:40.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'll tell everyone about it after we leave here and go to another room.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.95,0:08:47.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If two foreigners and someone with such a mean look in his eyes were seen leaving this room at the same time...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.33,0:08:49.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That would be memorable and rumors would spread.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.38,0:08:52.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There's no one in the corridor now.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.55,0:08:53.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,R-Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.22,0:08:55.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Let's go somewhere else.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:01.64,0:09:03.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I want you to hear it as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:04.56,0:09:06.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It'll be over quick.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.71,0:09:29.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, find it?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.34,0:09:30.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Whatever you forgot.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.34,0:09:35.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I guess I was wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.51,0:09:37.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.02,0:09:47.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Mr. Lookout, you should go stay in the room after all.
