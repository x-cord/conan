Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.82,0:06:52.82,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You haven't told the director, have you?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.82,0:06:53.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The real circumstances.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.08,0:07:01.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, I only told him that we're with the FBI and that she's a material witness in a case.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.08,0:07:03.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,How could I tell him?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.58,0:07:09.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That the famous announcer, Mizunashi Rena, is actually a member of a deadly organization we're hunting...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.97,0:07:15.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And that another member has infiltrated into the hospital as a patient to find her.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.06,0:07:18.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's for the director's own safety, after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:19.60,0:07:21.69,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But there is one silver lining.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.11,0:07:28.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even if those guys did locate her hospital room...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:28.86,0:07:33.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It would be too risky to be taking an unconscious body outside.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.82,0:07:34.87,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.03,0:07:38.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We must give 100% toward not getting discovered.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.50,0:07:41.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If only for the Director and other staff members cooperating with us.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.17,0:07:45.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even if they didn't know the situation...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.96,0:07:50.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I think those known to be helping us hide her are in danger of becoming targets of the Organization.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.30,0:07:58.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The issue now is how will we determine which of those three is their member disguised as a patient.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:00.06,0:08:05.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Normally, I would take the three of them, transfer them to another hospital, and interrogate them at length.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.19,0:08:07.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,This is Japan.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.19,0:08:11.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since our investigation isn't sanctioned by the Japanese police...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:11.78,0:08:13.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We can't do that
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.74,0:08:17.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And two of them are just normal patients.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.04,0:08:25.54,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Having said that, if we approach the suspects badly here, they will realize we're the FBI...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.54,0:08:28.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And they would know it's likely that she's being held in this hospital.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.63,0:08:29.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, then...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.76,0:08:33.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why not try the good idea I've come up with?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:34.38,0:08:35.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,"Good idea"?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.80,0:08:40.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'll tell everyone about it after we leave here and go to another room.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.77,0:08:47.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If two foreigners and someone with such a mean look in his eyes were seen leaving this room at the same time...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:47.11,0:08:49.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That would be memorable and rumors would spread.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:50.19,0:08:52.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,There's no one in the corridor now.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.36,0:08:53.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,R-Right.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.03,0:08:55.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Let's go somewhere else.

Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.52,0:09:29.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, find it?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:30.15,0:09:30.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Whatever you forgot.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:33.15,0:09:34.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I guess I was wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.32,0:09:37.07,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Sorry.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.83,0:09:47.71,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Mr. Lookout, you should go stay in the room after all.
