Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.90,0:05:43.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why's that?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.83,0:05:45.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because when the third call came...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.99,0:05:48.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The person's tone suddenly changed.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.11,0:06:12.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:13.07,0:06:14.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Let me take a look at the cell phone.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.49,0:06:18.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I told my boss all about it the next day, but ended up being scolded.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.70,0:06:24.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,From then on, I kept the cell phone on, but no one called for the entire day.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.17,0:06:30.83,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As expected, it's not strange at all that no one called.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.84,0:06:31.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why's that?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.09,0:06:34.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because this cell phone won't connect.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.55,0:06:41.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Listen, even while dialing, it gets a busy tone.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.21,0:06:43.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Indeed.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.41,0:06:43.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.47,0:06:49.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The owner of this cell phone couldn't pay his cell phone bill, so his phone's service was disabled.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.40,0:06:53.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In other words, the dangerous-sounding man who called was a debt collector!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:53.61,0:06:58.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Under the impression that the man was living alone, he hung up when a woman picked up...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.20,0:07:00.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Thinking he had called the wrong number.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.82,0:07:07.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As such, he rechecked the phone number, and when he called for the third time, he was livid.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.58,0:07:08.66,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.66,0:07:13.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What about the second time when he asked if there was anything ringing?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.55,0:07:20.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's probably because when he called in front of his apartment...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.34,0:07:24.81,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He didn't hear the ring sound, so he thought it was strange.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.18,0:07:25.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Say...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.27,0:07:29.52,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Do you still remember the customer that left this cell phone behind?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.88,0:07:30.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.81,0:07:33.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He came in after noon.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.77,0:07:36.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He wore glasses, had a side part, and was a little chubby.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.32,0:07:42.53,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He kept playing with his colorful cell phone, so I remember him clearly.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.28,0:07:48.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When the first call came, it was about an hour after he left.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:48.70,0:07:51.15,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The second call came not long after the first one.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:51.96,0:07:54.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The third one came about 30 minutes after that.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:56.75,0:08:05.01,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The incoming calls are shown as unknown numbers and the call-out and call-in records are blank as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.47,0:08:09.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,For the contact list, there are a lot of names and numbers in there.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.48,0:08:13.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, did you try calling one of those numbers?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.48,0:08:17.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I tried calling before, but it seems like they were all fake numbers.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:17.57,0:08:20.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And the names seem to be fake as well.
