Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.45,0:10:07.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, you should be thankful.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.00,0:10:16.26,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The one who got the info that Kir had been gravely injured and might be in a hospital somewhere was me, after all.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:16.92,0:10:21.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The FBI seems to be hiding that kid you got that information from.
