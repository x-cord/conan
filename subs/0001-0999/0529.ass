Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.74,0:06:35.58,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And since you don't even know where the victim went to a wake...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.58,0:06:37.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That makes it impossible to solve.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:37.75,0:06:38.33,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.87,0:06:40.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, the answer is simple...

Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.88,0:06:45.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's it, isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.67,0:06:47.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Her alibi is solid.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.72,0:06:51.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The best evidence is that you talked to the victim yourself.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.18,0:06:52.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, still...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.89,0:06:55.06,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It could have been some sort of deceit...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.94,0:07:06.28,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, if that's all, you'll need to find someone else to be the culprit.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.28,0:07:09.99,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What did Dad say?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.20,0:07:13.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He was busy playing mahjong, so we'll have to find someone else.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.16,0:07:16.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And, even then, he wasn't really playing mahjong...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.29,0:07:18.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It was a tape, a tape!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.91,0:07:22.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I know he used it a number of times in the past.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.04,0:07:25.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You'll get nearly the same sound by using one.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.71,0:07:27.76,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.76,0:07:29.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What do you mean by sound?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.38,0:07:30.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's because...

Dialogue: 0,0:07:33.47,0:07:35.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The culprit can decide where to cut it...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.68,0:07:39.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's it...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.60,0:07:41.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The husband didn't want it to be known...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.40,0:07:44.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That was the reason for the underhanded trick...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.69,0:07:47.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Could it be that his trick was seen through...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:47.98,0:07:50.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Without him realizing just how it would come back?
