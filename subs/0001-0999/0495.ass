Dialogue: 0,0:08:25.77,0:08:31.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah, if you trust the story that the CIA is pursuing Mizunashi Rena's whereabouts as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.65,0:08:32.78,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's almost certain.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.20,0:08:34.45,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, isn't it strange?

Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.16,0:08:45.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right
Dialogue: 0,0:08:45.37,0:08:49.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since the Organization is pursuing her whereabouts as well, he would be in danger if they noticed him.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.55,0:08:51.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He could hinder the CIA's operations as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.55,0:08:56.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Moreover, if he's really their operative's son, there'd be no reason not to stop him.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:46.47,0:13:49.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When he brought his son with him, it was just the two of them.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:51.22,0:13:54.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That means he never saw the faces of his father's CIA colleagues.

Dialogue: 0,0:14:18.96,0:14:20.79,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,By saying he found a clue to a member of his father's company...
Dialogue: 0,0:14:23.30,0:14:27.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The father told his colleagues at the Okonomiyaki shop, "I'll dive in deeper."
