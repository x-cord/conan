Dialogue: 0,0:03:09.90,0:03:15.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's right. I had Masuko{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r} always carry a cell phone.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.85,0:03:27.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Things like business transactions and scheduling exhibitions.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.48,0:04:04.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I see. So that's why a call from just the other room wouldn't be heard.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:05.96,0:04:08.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, did anyone else leave the room?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.63,0:04:10.42,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,No, no one else.

Dialogue: 0,0:04:21.77,0:04:24.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,everyone has an alibi of being in the stateroom.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:24.64,0:04:28.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's what I'm saying! It was a suicide!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.48,0:04:34.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Her feet were bare because she was upset and about to kill herself,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:34.35,0:04:37.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and her feet weren't dirty because she used the stepping stones
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.29,0:04:40.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,between the house and the storeroom.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.59,0:04:45.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Plus, she had broken the Fusui-maru in this storeroom.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.70,0:04:49.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I can imagine her seeing the storeroom when she woke up
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.70,0:04:52.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and walking in without too much thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.14,0:04:58.88,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's true. The rop{\i1}e was{\i0} used in this storeroom for packing things.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:58.88,0:05:03.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Plus we all heard the pot break at the same time.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:03.48,0:05:06.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In any case, we won't make any progress
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.49,0:05:09.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,until we examine the storeroom in more detail.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.36,0:05:13.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I ask that you all wait in the stateroom for the time being.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:13.03,0:05:15.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Please don't do anything without permission.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.96,0:05:21.96,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}Suicide? Is that really what it was?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.24,0:05:25.73,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}Still, too many things are out of the ordinary.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.74,0:05:30.31,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}The open cut on her right leg...

Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.18,0:05:36.24,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}And...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:37.98,0:05:43.86,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}...this marble I found by the broken Fusui-maru the day before...
Dialogue: 0,0:05:43.86,0:05:46.06,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}And what's the other thing?!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.06,0:05:50.03,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}Something I saw at the scene of the crime is bugging me!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:50.03,0:05:51.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Alright, you!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:52.26,0:05:54.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Oh, just a marble.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.23,0:05:57.36,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Only kids would be interested in junk like that.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:47.35,0:06:48.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What is it?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.38,0:06:50.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I forgot something.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.12,0:06:52.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe so, but you can't just barge in here.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.86,0:06:54.73,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Huh? Where's the lady's body?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.73,0:06:56.80,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Taken to the police hospital.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.47,0:07:12.17,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}The fact it's here means that up above is...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.32,0:07:18.58,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}Just as I thought!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.72,0:07:23.81,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}Using this method, you wouldn't need to be in the room to kill her!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.96,0:07:32.33,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}But to ensure she would die, it would have to be around there...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.63,0:07:33.96,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}Alright!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.27,0:07:40.64,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,H-Hey! What are you doing! Come down!

Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.07,0:08:14.47,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}Which means one of those two is the killer...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.47,0:08:16.98,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}...but it's probably that one.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.98,0:08:21.31,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}He laid a trap for her and killed her to make it look like a suicide...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.31,0:08:27.68,Thoughts,,0,0,0,,{\be10}And only he would still have proof of it on him!

Dialogue: 0,0:13:07.80,0:13:12.41,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,and solidify the alibi of the killer inside the stateroom.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:12.41,0:13:15.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then what about the cut on her right calf?

Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.08,0:13:31.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,When she lost her balance and fell, she likely cut her calf on that nail.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:33.63,0:13:37.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,probably because she had held on to the shelf for a few seconds.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:37.16,0:13:41.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Meaning she just happened to get the cut on her calf?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:41.60,0:13:46.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yes. It wasn't part of the killer's plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:46.04,0:13:50.68,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He was probably quite shocked when he saw her cut.
