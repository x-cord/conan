Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.10,0:06:21.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What's the meaning of this?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.52,0:06:22.61,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Why did the car stop?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.27,0:06:27.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I heard on that FBI agent's radio that you were coming to rescue me.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.28,0:06:33.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I saw my chance and hit him with the bomb case they gave me and pulled the hand brake.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.45,0:06:34.12,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:34.12,0:06:37.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even though the FBI had you hospitalized, you were conscious?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.79,0:06:40.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I came to two or three days ago.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:40.83,0:06:44.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The FBI thought I was in a coma the whole time, though.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.88,0:06:49.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I guess that means we've recovered Kir safely without getting caught.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.97,0:06:50.63,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.26,0:06:53.51,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,They left such an important task to just one man.

Dialogue: 0,0:07:25.13,0:07:28.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Could that guy have left a live bomb in his pocket!?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.63,0:07:35.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Could the fuse have been triggered from the force of the car crash?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.68,0:07:41.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What, an accident?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:43.40,0:07:44.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,It's bad!

Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.85,0:08:25.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You handed Mizunashi Rena over to the Organization on purpose!?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.90,0:08:30.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's why I had Camel call attention to his driving skills.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:31.69,0:08:37.16,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That way, he would be the obvious choice to drive the car taking Mizunashi Rena from the hospital.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:37.91,0:08:40.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So, we led them to figure it out...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.70,0:08:42.50,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And let them recover her.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:43.04,0:08:48.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right, we gave them the impression that they had figured out our plan and had completely outwitted us.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.38,0:08:52.46,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's the strategy this boy and I carefully crafted.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:52.88,0:08:54.47,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,T-Then, wait...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.47,0:08:59.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You mean my getting knocked out by this gorilla was also part of your scheme!?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:00.81,0:09:04.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I gave him instructions to silence anyone who got in the way.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.06,0:09:12.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Also, we were fortunate that we could make them the driver had been killed using their own bomb.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:17.24,0:09:21.08,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He had the car drift so the driver's side was facing the guardrail.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:21.54,0:09:25.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In order to escape, the door had to come to a perfect position.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.25,0:09:31.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,If he didn't match his escape with the timing of the explosion, the plan would have failed.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.68,0:09:40.72,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I couldn't entrust that to someone with such poor driving skills as you, now could I?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.56,0:09:44.10,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,B-But...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.10,0:09:47.77,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Mizunashi Rena was our only thread to them...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.77,0:09:50.94,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,How could you stand by and let them take her?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:51.40,0:09:54.40,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I made an arrangement with her last night.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.94,0:09:59.74,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,An arrangement to make her not just a thread, but a fishing line for the FBI...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.41,0:10:04.91,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And one that would make her a part of this boy's scheme.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.12,0:10:11.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You never fail to amaze, kid.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:11.96,0:10:13.96,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm just glad you're an ally, Akai{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}.
