Dialogue: 0,0:13:26.20,0:13:32.62,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then maybe it's Saori{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-san{\r}. She told you to\Neat proper meals and take a bath, didn't she?
Dialogue: 0,0:13:32.99,0:13:38.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because if you went out to eat, or went to take\Na bath, she would be able to escape from here.

Dialogue: 0,0:13:46.84,0:13:51.39,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Because when you called her, we couldn't hear her voice.
Dialogue: 0,0:13:51.72,0:13:56.98,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That means the culprit is hiding somewhere\Nwhere they can't hear voices or sounds from here.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:01.63,0:15:05.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Well, now. First of all, I'd open the window for ventilation.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:06.25,0:15:07.92,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey! No way.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:08.63,0:15:11.55,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You're not saying Tago is out on the veranda are you?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:11.55,0:15:13.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's it exactly.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:13.64,0:15:15.89,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,At any cost, he needed you to open it.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:16.39,0:15:18.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,In order to get off of the veranda.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.73,0:15:22.35,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Earlier, after we left the veranda...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:27.32,0:15:29.57,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You locked the window, didn't you?
Dialogue: 0,0:15:30.07,0:15:34.49,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,That's it. Since you always leave the window open...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:34.82,0:15:38.95,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He expected you to leave it open when\Nyou went to sleep after finishing the model.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:39.29,0:15:45.59,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. As long as you left the window open for him, he could\Npeer through the curtains to see what was going on in the room.
Dialogue: 0,0:15:45.79,0:15:48.67,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But when we went out there earlier there was nobody there.

Dialogue: 0,0:15:50.72,0:15:53.30,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Eh? Where we could see...
Dialogue: 0,0:15:54.89,0:16:00.60,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,You see it now, right? That's why he told you to\Ndo the washing and the laundry when you woke up.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:08.19,0:16:10.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Right. He said that because...
Dialogue: 0,0:16:12.20,0:16:16.70,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Of course, he didn't want you to open the lid of that washing machine.

Dialogue: 0,0:16:23.83,0:16:28.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Incidentally, the reason he told you he would\Ncome in the morning and do the washing was...
Dialogue: 0,0:16:28.50,0:16:32.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He planned to enter the room from the veranda at\Na time he decided it was likely for you to be asleep,

Dialogue: 0,0:16:50.44,0:16:57.03,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah. Of course, his height and physique\NI asked you about was the deciding factor.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:57.53,0:17:05.75,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Since he used that chair as a footstool in order to get the album\Nfrom the top shelf of the bookcase, the culprit must be a short person.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:05.75,0:17:11.17,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Besides, if he wasn't a fairly short person,\Nhe couldn't hide inside that washing machine.
