Dialogue: 0,0:05:41.98,0:05:44.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Only that much.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.32,0:05:47.11,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Here you go.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.68,0:06:16.23,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I already told you, the week before last\Ntheir fight was about cars and clothes.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:16.60,0:06:19.31,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I'm asking why they fought over something like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:20.15,0:06:21.90,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,I don't know.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:21.90,0:06:28.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Maybe it was because Ena{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-chan{\r} told Sudou to drive\Nhere in his classic car, but he came in his new car.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:28.24,0:06:33.24,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Later it was because Sudou didn't come wearing\Nthe clothes Ena bought him for the party.

Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.58,0:06:37.20,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,What kind?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.92,0:06:48.22,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As for the sweater, Ena gave it to him.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.22,0:06:52.93,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,As for fleece, Sudou has liked it ever since he\Nstarted the company and has worn it often, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:52.93,0:06:55.85,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He didn't much like wool.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.85,0:06:59.56,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But he came wearing a wool sweater last week, didn't he?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.56,0:07:01.48,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,He even drove that classic car, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.48,0:07:07.32,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,And yet, when Ena saw Sudou kun holding a\Nplastic bottle of mineral water, she got really angry.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.65,0:07:08.86,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.86,0:07:13.37,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,She said, "You were loitering at some gasoline stand\Non the way even though everyone was waiting."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.37,0:07:17.04,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Sudou irritably replied, "No one tells me where to go."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.33,0:07:22.29,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Then, Ena spilled the wine she was holding on Sudou{\rHonorifics - Dialogue}-kun{\r}'s sweater.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.29,0:07:26.84,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ena started to cry and said, "I'm sorry!\NI'll buy you a new one. I'm sorry."
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.59,0:07:30.38,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,The party last week was ruined as well.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.38,0:07:32.05,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,But, that's strange...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:32.64,0:07:36.97,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Ena said before that she hates classic cars.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.52,0:07:40.02,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Classic car...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:40.64,0:07:42.14,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Wool sweater...

Dialogue: 0,0:08:03.83,0:08:06.13,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Even if he tells us to enjoy it...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.13,0:08:08.00,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,We're thinking about the case...
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.46,0:08:10.21,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,So we couldn't enjoy it, could we?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:10.76,0:08:13.34,Dialogue,,0,0,0,,Hey, Shin'ichi, haven't you solved it yet?
